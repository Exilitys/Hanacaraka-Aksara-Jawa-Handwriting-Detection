# Hanacaraka Aksara Jawa Handwriting Detection

A deep learning project for recognizing handwritten Javanese script (Aksara Jawa/Hanacaraka) characters using a fine-tuned ResNet50V2 model, complete with an interactive web application for real-time predictions.

## Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network to classify 20 different Javanese script characters. The model uses transfer learning with ResNet50V2 as the base architecture and achieves high accuracy (>96%) through data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques. An interactive Streamlit web application is included for easy testing and demonstration.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Fine-tuned ResNet50V2 for 20-class Javanese character classification
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit-based interface for real-time image classification
- **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: Complete notebook with data preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- **Model Persistence**: Saved model and class mappings for deployment

## Dataset

The training data comes from two Kaggle datasets:
- [Javanese Script Aksara Jawa Augmented](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hannanhunafa/javanese-script-aksara-jawa-augmented)
- [Hanacaraka](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vzrenggamani/hanacaraka)

The dataset contains images of 20 different Javanese characters with the following split:
- **Training**: 70%
- **Validation**: 15%
- **Testing**: 15%

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: ResNet50V2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input Shape**: 224 Ã— 224 Ã— 3
- **Architecture**:
  - ResNet50V2 base (frozen initially)
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense layer (256 units, ReLU activation, L2 regularization)
  - Dropout (0.5)
  - Output layer (20 units, Softmax activation)

## Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Feature Extraction
- Freeze ResNet50V2 base layers
- Train only the classifier head
- Learning rate: 1e-4

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning
- Unfreeze last 40 layers of ResNet50V2
- Fine-tune with lower learning rate: 1e-5
- Data augmentation applied during training

### Data Augmentation
- Rotation: Â±20 degrees
- Zoom: 0.9-1.0
- Width/Height shift: Â±20%
- Shear: Â±20%
- ResNet50V2 preprocessing

### Callbacks
- **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation loss, patience=5
- **Learning Rate Reduction**: Factor=0.2, patience=3

## API Usage

You can also use the model programmatically:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2 import preprocess_input
import pickle

# Load model and class mappings
model = load_model('model/ResNet50-FineTune-40Fl.keras')

with open('model/class-indicies.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    class_indicies = pickle.load(f)

label_map = {v: k for k, v in class_indicies}

# Preprocess and predict
img = image.load_img('path/to/image.jpg', target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

# Get prediction
pred_probs = model.predict(img_array)[0]
pred_label = label_map[np.argmax(pred_probs)]
confidence = np.max(pred_probs)

print(f"Predicted: {pred_label} (Confidence: {confidence:.2f})")
```
